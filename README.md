# MiniMyth2-theme

Minimyth2 skin based on Ted's Verhagen inspiratopm by MediaStream theme.
The theme has been made to look like the original XBMC skin were posible. It has added components required by MiniMyth2 
extra functionality like: extra OSD notifications, BluRay/DVD ripping, extra maintenace tools and SIP telephony client.
Looks best with the matching menu called 'Minimyth2' as this menu layout and items are tailored for this particular theme.
